			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			<p>
				The only one of my projects that are on my website is <a href="desertic/" class="nav-link">Desertic</a>! <a href="desertic/" class="nav-link">Desertic</a> is a voxel game that has strong inspiration from Minecraft. The point of the game is to survive in the desert you spawn in! Keep in mind that this game is in pre-alpha so it is not finished and there will be bugs.
